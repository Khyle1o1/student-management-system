# Fee Management System - Complete Implementation Guide 🎉

## 🚀 What's Been Implemented

### ✅ **Scoped Fee Creation** 
Just like events, fees can now be created with specific scopes:
- **University-wide**: Applies to all 7,300+ students across all colleges
- **College-wide**: Applies only to students from a specific college (e.g., College of Technologies)
- **Course-specific**: Applies only to students from a specific course (e.g., Bachelor of Science in Information Technology)

### ✅ **Enhanced Fee Form**
- **Scope Selection**: Choose who the fee applies to with real-time student count preview
- **Dynamic Dropdowns**: College selection enables course selection for course-specific fees
- **Student Impact Preview**: See exactly how many students will be assigned the fee
- **Complete Validation**: Ensures scope requirements are met before creation

### ✅ **Fee Management Dashboard**
- **Individual Fee Management**: Each fee has a dedicated management page (`/dashboard/fees/[id]/manage`)
- **Student Assignment**: View all students assigned to a specific fee based on its scope
- **Payment Status Tracking**: See which students have paid, partially paid, or haven't paid
- **Payment Recording**: Manually record payments with method, reference, and notes
- **Summary Statistics**: Collection rates, revenue tracking, and payment progress

### ✅ **Smart Student Assignment**
- **Scope-Based Assignment**: Students only see fees that apply to them
- **Automatic Filtering**: University-wide fees show to all, college fees to college students only
- **Historical Payments**: Students can see payments for fees from previous years

### ✅ **Enhanced APIs**
- **Scope Validation**: Fee creation validates scope requirements
- **Student Filtering**: APIs automatically filter students based on fee scope
- **Payment Management**: Complete CRUD operations for payment tracking

## 🗃️ Database Changes

### **New fee_structures Columns:**
- `scope_type`: UNIVERSITY_WIDE | COLLEGE_WIDE | COURSE_SPECIFIC
- `scope_college`: Required for college-wide and course-specific fees
- `scope_course`: Required for course-specific fees
- `type`: Fee type classification
- `semester`: Optional semester assignment
- `school_year`: Required school year
- `is_active`: Active status flag
- `deleted_at`: Soft delete timestamp

### **Enhanced payments Table:**
- `payment_method`: Cash, Check, Bank Transfer, GCash, etc.
- `reference`: Receipt numbers, transaction IDs
- `notes`: Additional payment information
- `deleted_at`: Soft delete timestamp

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Step 1: Apply Database Migration**
Run the migration to add scope functionality:
```sql
-- Apply migration_add_fee_scope.sql to your database
-- This adds scope columns and payment tracking fields
```

### **Step 2: Create Your First Scoped Fee**
1. Go to `/dashboard/fees/new`
2. Fill in fee details (name, type, amount, due date)
3. Select fee scope:
   - **University-wide**: For fees like registration or general activity fees
   - **College-wide**: For college-specific fees like lab fees for engineering students
   - **Course-specific**: For course-specific fees like practicum fees for nursing students
4. See real-time student count preview
5. Create the fee

### **Step 3: Manage Fee Payments**
1. Go to `/dashboard/fees` to see all fees
2. Click "Manage" on any fee to see assigned students
3. View payment statistics and collection rates
4. Record payments manually using "Add Payment" button
5. Filter and search students by payment status

## 💡 Use Cases
