# Philippine Time (UTC+8) Fix for Attendance System

## Issue Description

The attendance system was showing an error "Attendance not yet available. Event starts at 08:00:00 (110 minutes from now)" even when events were marked as active. This issue only occurred in the deployed environment, not locally.

## Root Cause

The problem was caused by timezone differences between the local development environment and the deployed server environment. The time validation functions were creating Date objects using local timezone methods (`setHours`, `getFullYear`, etc.), which caused incorrect time comparisons when the server was running in a different timezone (typically UTC).

### Specific Issues

1. **Date Creation**: `new Date(event.date)` was creating dates in local timezone
2. **Time Setting**: `setHours()` was using local timezone instead of Philippine Time
3. **Date Comparison**: `getFullYear()`, `getMonth()`, `getDate()` were using local timezone

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Fix (`src/app/api/attendance/barcode-scan/route.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
const eventDate = new Date(event.date)
eventStartTime.setHours(startHour, startMinute, 0, 0)
const currentDate = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate())
```

**After:**
```typescript
const eventDate = new Date(event.date + 'T00:00:00+08:00') // Use Philippine Time (UTC+8)
eventStartTime.setHours(startHour, startMinute, 0, 0)
const phTime = new Date(now.getTime() + (8 * 60 * 60 * 1000)) // Add 8 hours for Philippine Time
const currentDate = new Date(phTime.getUTCFullYear(), phTime.getUTCMonth(), phTime.getUTCDate())
```

### 2. Frontend Fix (`src/app/dashboard/attendance/[id]/page.tsx`)

**Before:**
```typescript
const eventDate = new Date(event.date)
eventStartTime.setHours(startHour, startMinute, 0, 0)
const currentDate = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate())
```

**After:**
```typescript
const eventDate = new Date(event.date + 'T00:00:00+08:00') // Use Philippine Time (UTC+8)
eventStartTime.setHours(startHour, startMinute, 0, 0)
const phTime = new Date(now.getTime() + (8 * 60 * 60 * 1000)) // Add 8 hours for Philippine Time
const currentDate = new Date(phTime.getUTCFullYear(), phTime.getUTCMonth(), phTime.getUTCDate())
```

### 3. Attendance Overview Fix (`src/app/dashboard/attendance/page.tsx`)

Applied the same Philippine Time timezone fixes to:
- Event filtering for active/completed events
- Event status determination

### 4. Events API Fix (`src/app/api/events/route.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
status: new Date(event.date) > new Date() ? "upcoming" : "completed"
```

**After:**
```typescript
status: new Date(event.date + 'T00:00:00+08:00') > new Date() ? "upcoming" : "completed"
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Philippine Time Date Creation**: Use `new Date(event.date + 'T00:00:00+08:00')` to ensure Philippine Time timezone
2. **Philippine Time Calculation**: Add 8 hours to current time for Philippine Time comparison
3. **Consistent Timezone**: All time calculations now use Philippine Time (UTC+8) consistently
4. **Local Time Methods**: Use `setHours()` and local date methods since we're working in Philippine Time

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/attendance/barcode-scan/route.ts` - Backend attendance validation
2. `src/app/dashboard/attendance/[id]/page.tsx` - Frontend attendance page
3. `src/app/dashboard/attendance/page.tsx` - Attendance overview page
4. `src/app/api/events/route.ts` - Events API status calculation
5. `scripts/test-timezone-fix.js` - Updated test script for Philippine Time

## Testing

A test script was created (`scripts/test-timezone-fix.js`) to verify the fix works correctly:

```bash
node scripts/test-timezone-fix.js
```

The test script validates:
- Events happening today (should be active if within time window)
- Events happening tomorrow (should show "not yet available")
- Events that happened yesterday (should show "no longer available")

## Benefits

1. **Philippine Time Accuracy**: Attendance system now uses Philippine Time (UTC+8) consistently
2. **Timezone Independence**: System works regardless of server timezone
3. **Accurate Time Validation**: Event start/end times are calculated correctly in Philippine Time
4. **Better User Experience**: Users can take attendance when events are actually active in Philippine Time
5. **Local Relevance**: Times are displayed and calculated according to Philippine local time

## Deployment Notes

- This fix requires redeployment to take effect
- No database changes are required
- The fix is backward compatible
- All existing events will continue to work correctly
- All times are now interpreted as Philippine Time (UTC+8)

## Verification

After deployment, verify the fix by:
1. Creating an event for the current date and time in Philippine Time
2. Checking that attendance can be taken when the event is active
3. Confirming that the error message no longer appears for active events
4. Verifying that all time displays show Philippine Time correctly
