   - Comprehensive API endpoints
   - Proper timestamp tracking

## 🗂️ **Files Created/Modified:**

### **New Files:**
- `attendance_enhancement_migration.sql` - Database schema enhancement
- `src/app/api/attendance/barcode-scan/route.ts` - Main attendance API
- `src/app/api/attendance/event/[eventId]/stats/route.ts` - Statistics API
- `src/app/dashboard/attendance/manage/page.tsx` - Main attendance page

### **Modified Files:**
- `src/components/dashboard/dashboard-shell.tsx` - Added navigation link

## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions:**

### **Step 1: Apply Database Migration**

**Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `attendance_enhancement_migration.sql`
4. Run the SQL commands

**Option B: Using Database Admin Tool**
Copy the SQL from `attendance_enhancement_migration.sql` and run it in your preferred database tool.

**Option C: Manual Setup (if you have command line access)**
```sql
-- Add the required columns to attendance table
ALTER TABLE attendance 
ADD COLUMN time_in TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN time_out TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN mode VARCHAR(20) CHECK (mode IN ('SIGN_IN', 'SIGN_OUT'));

-- Update existing records
UPDATE attendance 
SET time_in = created_at, mode = 'SIGN_IN'
WHERE time_in IS NULL;

-- Add indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_attendance_time_in ON attendance(time_in);
CREATE INDEX idx_attendance_mode ON attendance(mode);
```

### **Step 2: Access the Feature**

1. **For Admins**: Navigate to Dashboard → **"Manage Attendance"** (new menu item)
2. **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/attendance/manage`

### **Step 3: Test the System**

1. **Select an Event**
   - Choose from active/upcoming events
   - View event details and scope

2. **Test Sign-In**
   - Select "Sign In" mode
   - Enter a valid student ID (numbers only)
   - Should show success message

3. **Test Sign-Out**
   - Select "Sign Out" mode  
   - Enter the same student ID
   - Should show success message

4. **Test Validation**
   - Try invalid student ID → Should show error
   - Try duplicate sign-in → Should show error
   - Try sign-out without sign-in → Should show error

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### **Event Selection:**
- Loads all active events from your database
- Filters by event scope (University-wide, College-wide, Course-specific)
- Shows event details including date, time, location, and scope

### **Barcode Scanning:**
- Accepts numeric student IDs (matching your system format)
- Validates student existence in database
- Checks eligibility based on event scope
- Prevents duplicate operations

### **Validation Logic:**
```
✅ SIGN IN: Student exists + Eligible for event + Not already signed in
✅ SIGN OUT: Student exists + Previously signed in + Not already signed out
❌ ERRORS: Student not found, not eligible, or invalid operation
```

### **Database Schema:**
```sql
attendance table now includes:
- time_in: When student signed in
- time_out: When student signed out (null if not signed out)
- mode: 'SIGN_IN' or 'SIGN_OUT'
- status: 'PRESENT' (existing)
```

## 📊 **Real-Time Statistics:**

The page shows live attendance statistics:
- **Total Sign-ins**: Number of students who signed in
- **Currently Present**: Students currently in the event (signed in but not signed out)
- **Total Sign-outs**: Number of students who signed out

## 🔧 **API Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/attendance/barcode-scan` - Main attendance recording
- `GET /api/attendance/event/[eventId]/stats` - Live statistics
- `GET /api/events` - Event listing (existing)

## 🚀 **Usage Example:**

1. **Admin opens Manage Attendance page**
2. **Selects "Engineering Workshop" event**
3. **Event shows scope: "Computer Science students only"**
4. **Switches to "Sign In" mode**
5. **Scans student barcode: "2024001"**
6. **System validates: Student exists + Is CS student + Not signed in**
7. **✅ Shows: "John Doe has signed in at 14:30"**
8. **Statistics update: "Currently Present: 1"**

## 🎨 **UI Features:**

- **Modern Design**: Clean, professional interface
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Real-time Updates**: Statistics refresh automatically
- **Toast Notifications**: Clear success/error messages
- **Loading States**: Shows processing status
- **Auto-focus**: Input ready for scanning
- **Auto-clear**: Input clears after successful scan

## 🔒 **Security Features:**

- **Authentication**: Requires login
- **Authorization**: Admin-only access
- **Input Validation**: Prevents invalid data
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries
- **Event Scope Enforcement**: Students can only attend eligible events

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting:**

**Issue**: Toast notifications not showing
**Solution**: Toaster component already included in layout.tsx ✅

**Issue**: Navigation link not appearing  
**Solution**: Added to dashboard-shell.tsx ✅

**Issue**: Database errors
**Solution**: Apply the migration script first

**Issue**: Student not found
**Solution**: Ensure student ID matches exactly (numbers only)

## 🎯 **Ready to Use!**

The Manage Attendance feature is now complete and ready for production use. Simply apply the database migration and start using the new attendance management system!

### **Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Efficient**: Quick barcode scanning
- ✅ **Accurate**: Comprehensive validation
- ✅ **Real-time**: Live statistics and feedback  
- ✅ **Secure**: Proper authentication and authorization
- ✅ **User-friendly**: Clear interface and messaging
