# Certificate and Evaluation System Implementation

## üéØ Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive certificate and evaluation system to the Student Management System. It includes automatic certificate generation, conditional release based on evaluations, email notifications, and detailed tracking.

## ‚ú® Features Implemented

### 1. Certificate Generation & Conditional Release
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Generation**: Certificates are automatically generated for students marked as present
- ‚úÖ **Conditional Access**: Certificates are only accessible after evaluation completion (if required)
- ‚úÖ **Unique Certificate Numbers**: Each certificate gets a unique identifier
- ‚úÖ **Access Control**: Students can only access their own certificates

### 2. Evaluation System (Admin Side)
- ‚úÖ **Evaluation Creation**: Admins can create evaluation templates with multiple question types
- ‚úÖ **Question Types**: Support for multiple choice, rating, text, and boolean questions
- ‚úÖ **Event Integration**: Link evaluations to events during creation
- ‚úÖ **Template Management**: Save evaluations as reusable templates

### 3. Student Flow
- ‚úÖ **Evaluation Submission**: Students complete evaluations after attending events
- ‚úÖ **Response Validation**: Ensures all required questions are answered
- ‚úÖ **Certificate Unlock**: Certificates become accessible after evaluation submission
- ‚úÖ **Access Tracking**: All certificate views/downloads are logged

### 4. Email Notifications
- ‚úÖ **Attendance Confirmation**: Sent when students are marked present
- ‚úÖ **Evaluation Reminders**: Notify students about pending evaluations
- ‚úÖ **Certificate Ready**: Alert when certificates become available
- ‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Beautiful HTML emails with proper styling

### 5. Administrative Dashboard
- ‚úÖ **Bulk Certificate Generation**: Generate certificates for all attendees
- ‚úÖ **Evaluation Analytics**: View response statistics and completion rates
- ‚úÖ **Access Monitoring**: Track certificate downloads and views
- ‚úÖ **Status Management**: Monitor evaluation completion and certificate accessibility

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema

### New Tables Added

```sql
-- Evaluation templates and forms
CREATE TABLE evaluations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    questions JSONB NOT NULL, -- Store questions as JSON
    is_template BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Link events to evaluations
CREATE TABLE event_evaluations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    evaluation_id UUID REFERENCES evaluations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    is_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(event_id) -- One evaluation per event
);

-- Student evaluation responses
CREATE TABLE student_evaluation_responses (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    student_id UUID REFERENCES students(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    evaluation_id UUID REFERENCES evaluations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    responses JSONB NOT NULL, -- Store responses as JSON
    submitted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(event_id, student_id) -- One response per student per event
);

-- Certificate metadata
CREATE TABLE certificates (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    student_id UUID REFERENCES students(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    certificate_type VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'PARTICIPATION',
    generated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_accessible BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, -- Only accessible after evaluation completion
    file_path TEXT, -- Path to generated PDF
    certificate_number VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE, -- Unique certificate identifier
    UNIQUE(event_id, student_id) -- One certificate per student per event
);

-- Certificate access tracking
CREATE TABLE certificate_access_log (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    certificate_id UUID REFERENCES certificates(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    student_id UUID REFERENCES students(id),
    access_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'VIEW' or 'DOWNLOAD'
    accessed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT
);
```

### Updated Tables

```sql
-- Added evaluation requirement to events
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN require_evaluation BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Added tracking fields to attendance
ALTER TABLE attendance ADD COLUMN certificate_generated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE attendance ADD COLUMN evaluation_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

## üîÑ Workflow

### 1. Event Creation (Admin)
1. Admin creates an event
2. Optionally enables "Require Evaluation"
3. If evaluation required, selects or creates an evaluation template
4. Event is linked to evaluation automatically

### 2. Student Attendance
1. Student attends event and is marked present
2. Certificate is automatically generated
3. Certificate accessibility depends on evaluation requirement:
   - **No evaluation required**: Certificate immediately accessible
   - **Evaluation required**: Certificate locked until evaluation completion
4. Email notification sent to student

### 3. Evaluation Process (If Required)
1. Student receives email with evaluation link
2. Student completes evaluation form
3. System validates all required responses
4. Evaluation submission unlocks certificate
5. Certificate availability email sent

### 4. Certificate Access
1. Student can view/download certificate from dashboard
2. All access attempts are logged
3. Certificate includes unique number and event details

## üì° API Endpoints

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Email configuration (using Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# Application URLs for email links
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Email From Address
Update the from address in `src/lib/email.ts`:
```typescript
from: 'Student Management System <noreply@yourdomain.com>'
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Database Migration
Run the migration to add all required tables:
```bash
# Apply the migration in your database
psql your_database < certificate_evaluation_migration.sql
```

### 2. Environment Setup
Add the email configuration to your `.env` file:
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Test the System
1. Create an event with evaluation requirement enabled
2. Mark a student as present
3. Check that certificate is generated but not accessible
4. Complete the evaluation as the student
5. Verify certificate becomes accessible
6. Test email notifications (ensure RESEND_API_KEY is configured)

## üìä System Flow Examples

### University-wide Event with Evaluation
```
1. Admin creates "Annual Conference" (University-wide, requires evaluation)
2. Admin links "Conference Feedback" evaluation template
3. 500 students attend and are marked present
4. 500 certificates generated (all locked)
5. Email sent to all 500 students
6. Students complete evaluation
7. Certificates unlock as evaluations are submitted
8. Final email sent when certificate ready
```

### College Event without Evaluation
```
1. Admin creates "Engineering Job Fair" (College-wide, no evaluation)
2. 50 engineering students attend
3. 50 certificates generated (all accessible)
4. Email sent with direct certificate download links
5. Students can immediately access certificates
```

   - Check database migration was applied

2. **Emails not sending**
   - Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured
   - Check email domain verification in Resend
   - Review console logs for error messages

3. **Evaluation not unlocking certificate**
   - Ensure all required questions were answered
   - Check evaluation-event linking in database
   - Verify evaluation completion status in attendance table

4. **Student can't access certificate**
   - Check `is_accessible` flag in certificates table
   - Verify student completed required evaluation
   - Ensure student has proper authentication

### Debugging Tips
- Enable detailed logging in API endpoints
- Check browser network tab for API errors
- Use database queries to verify data integrity
- Test email functionality with admin accounts first
