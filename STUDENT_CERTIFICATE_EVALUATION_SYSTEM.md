        submittedAt: string | null
      },
      is_accessible: boolean,
      certificate_number: string
    }
  ],
  total: number,
  page: number,
  limit: number
}
```

### New Routes Created

#### 1. `/dashboard/certificates` - Student Certificates Page
```typescript
// Server component with authentication
// Only accessible to students
// Passes studentId to certificates component
```

#### 2. `/dashboard/events/[id]/evaluation` - Event Evaluation Page
```typescript
// Server component with authentication
// Only accessible to students
// Passes eventId and studentId to evaluation form
```

### New Components Created

#### 1. `StudentCertificates` Component
- **Certificate Display**: Cards showing event details and certificate status
- **Statistics**: Summary cards with counts and progress
- **Actions**: Download certificates or complete evaluations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states and loading indicators

#### 2. `EventEvaluationForm` Component
